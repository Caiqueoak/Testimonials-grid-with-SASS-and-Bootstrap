              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
              I got every penny’s worth.

              “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

              “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
              needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
              agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
